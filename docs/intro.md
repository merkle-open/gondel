Hello! Welcome to Gondel.

## What is it?

Gondel is a small non-intrusive library to help you modularize your code. It **doesn't** have a rendering engine, and is as close to vanilla javascript as you can get. But without the boring parts.

## But why?

Many libraries and frameworks today assume that you want everything. Gondel doesn't. It's perfect for adding a small piece of JavaScript logic to a DOM element of your choice. Why reach out to a big complicated library, when one with a tiny footprint has all that you need?

## Do you do plugins?

Yes! Currently [this plugins](plugins.md) exist, and some more are in development. However, since Gondel is pretty close to vanilla JavaScript, you can pretty much just write a class decorator, and your good to go!

If you have a good idea for a plugin, please feel free to make a Pull Request!
